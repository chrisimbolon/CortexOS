🌐 CortexOS — Modular AI Microservices Platform

CortexOS is a high-performance AI orchestration platform built with a modern microservices architecture.
It provides a clean, scalable way to run LLMs, embeddings, RAG pipelines, metrics logging, and API integrations — all fully containerized and production-ready.

This project is designed for real-world deployment, expandability, and developer ergonomics, making it perfect for:

AI/ML backend engineering

RAG-powered applications

LangChain-style LLM orchestration without the bloat

FastAPI microservice architecture

Portfolio-level demonstration of AI system design
